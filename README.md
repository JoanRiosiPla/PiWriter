# PiWriter

Code to generate coherent text following restrictions in word length, for example writing text that has words, limited by the digits o pi.

There are 2 branches: 
Markup : *Master: Attempted for the process to be completely autonomous, but it wasn't possible. - does not work
          *V2: Made it so that human interaction is needed. - works!
